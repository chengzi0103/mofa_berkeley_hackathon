"To solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0\), we can use the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the coefficients of the quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). In this case, \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 1\).

The discriminant of this equation, \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\), is \(2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 0\). Since the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root."
